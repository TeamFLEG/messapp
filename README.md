<h1>MessApp</h1>
<p align='justify'>The product is an android application used to manage daily mess attendance and streamline rebate and menu selection processes. The system's objective is to provide a user-friendly daily attendance system that is easy to operate, maintain and query. Our primary focus is to develop a paperless system that provides the management with a way to facilitate the smooth functioning of the mess system. In many organizations, entire mess management and billing calculations are done manually. It is very time-consuming and increases the chances of performing calculation mistakes. It would be possible to do the same work within a short period without using much effort and workforce if there existed software for the same. Thus, a smoother and faster method is needed, resulting in the need for an application.</p>
